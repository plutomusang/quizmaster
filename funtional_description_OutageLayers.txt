class OutageLayers:
    """
    The OutageLayers class is an integral part of an outage management system, 
    designed to handle, organize, and provide detailed information about service outages.
    It interacts with databases or external data sources to retrieve, manipulate, 
    and analyze outage-related data.

    Key Functionalities:
    - Data Retrieval: Fetches detailed information about outages, affected areas,
      and various data layers, which could be geographical or service-related.
    - Analytical Operations: Calculates total number of outages, determines the 
      number of customers affected in specific regions, and performs other analytical tasks.
    - Data Filtering and Aggregation: Filters and aggregates data based on criteria 
      for targeted analysis and reporting.
    - Utility and Support: Manages cache and implements data privacy measures, 
      ensuring data handling and security are up to standards.

    This class serves as a comprehensive interface for managing and analyzing outage-related data,
    crucial for systems dealing with service disruptions, resource allocation, and customer impact assessments.
